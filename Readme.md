### How to setup the server...

1. I have sent you a email to make you admin of the database ( It will make you the owner and I will leave which means no setup on your side)
2. I have setup the server code to use Render.com ( A free API hosting platform ) So no setup for that on your side as well

### Urls
Database -> Sent you an url to manage the Database as an Admin ( Will leave once both of us knows the program works )
API -> https://email-service-8e3q.onrender.com/submit

All the urls will continue to work forever, And you have access to all the code if you want to host on own infrastructure '
I will also help if there is an error the code ( Completely free )

### Limitations
1. The databas will be able to host around 300k to 500k emails ( 20mb of free space )

### I will be transfering ownership for everything to you.
